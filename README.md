# Void-Assay-Analysis
This page has simple MATLAB code to quantify void spots and void volume for void spot assays on chromatography paper of size 7 in. x 7 in.
Prior to use with this code, the void spot images should be cropped and rotated as needed, and standardized to a pixel size of 2200 x 2200 pixels. 
The rationale for the generation of function handles F1 and F2 used in the code are provided in the PDF, which shows our calculations for standard curves using mouse urine. Please note that this was conducted with mouse urine and results with rat/alternate animal models may be inaccurate.
